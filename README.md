# Asynchronous Email Verification with MuleSoft and AWS ðŸš€  

This project demonstrates an **asynchronous email verification system** using **MuleSoft, AWS SQS, and AWS S3**. The system efficiently processes email verification requests by leveraging **event-driven architecture** and **message queuing**, ensuring **scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance**.

## ðŸ›  Built With

Here are the awesome tools we used:
